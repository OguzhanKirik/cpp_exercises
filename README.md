C++ Exercises

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects and exercises developed to enhance proficiency in C++ programming. Each project focuses on different aspects of C++, ranging from basic syntax to advanced concepts like concurrency and system monitoring.

üöÄ Projects Overview

A*_search: Implementation of the A* search algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal.

Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation: Simulation of traffic flow using concurrent programming techniques to manage multiple vehicles.

System-Monitor: A system monitoring tool that provides real-time information about system resources and processes.

memory_management/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot: A chatbot application emphasizing dynamic memory management and smart pointers.

router_planner: A project focused on planning optimal routes, possibly using algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.

snake_game/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game: A classic snake game developed as a capstone project, showcasing object-oriented programming and game development skills.

üß† Key Concepts

Algorithm Implementation: Projects like A*_search and router_planner demonstrate the application of search and optimization algorithms.

Concurrency: The Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation project explores multithreading and synchronization mechanisms in C++.

System Programming: System-Monitor provides insights into interacting with system-level resources and APIs.

Memory Management: The chatbot project emphasizes proper handling of dynamic memory, smart pointers, and resource management.

Game Development: The snake game project encapsulates game logic, rendering, and user interaction using C++.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Build Systems: CMake, Makefile

Libraries: STL, pthreads (for concurrency), ncurses or similar (for game rendering)

Tools: Valgrind (for memory leak detection), gdb (for debugging)
