# C++ Projects 

This README provides a structured overview of the ** C++ Programs**, summarizing all chapters (courses), lessons, and associated projects. It is designed to help learners quickly understand the flow of the curriculum and the key tasks they will complete.

# 1. Introduction to C++ 

A foundational introduction to the C++ language, syntax, tools, and basic algorithms.

### **Lessons**

* **L1: Introduction to C++ and Setup** – Program structure, compilation, variables, types, I/O, conditionals, loops.
* **L2: Working with Data Structures and STL** – Arrays, vectors, STL algorithms, file I/O, error handling.
* **L3: Functions, Modularity, and OOP** – Functions, multi‑file projects, classes, pointers, object lifetime.
* **L4: Introduction to Algorithms – A* Search** – Basics of algorithms, graphs, A* pathfinding, STL containers.

### **Project**

#### **Build an OpenStreetMap Route Planner**

Create a graphical route‑planning program using real map data and an A* search implementation.

---

# 2. Object‑Oriented Programming in C++ 

Covers deep OOP concepts and good software design through encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.

### **Lessons**

* **L1: Encapsulation and Class Design** – Data hiding, getters/setters, class architecture.
* **L2: Inheritance, Composition, and Class Hierarchies** – Single/multiple inheritance, is‑a vs has‑a design.
* **L3: Polymorphism in Depth and Templates** – Runtime & compile‑time polymorphism, abstract classes, STL power.
* **L4: Error Handling Strategies and Debugging** – Exceptions, return codes, assertions, logging, RAII.

### **Project**

#### **Build a System Monitoring Tool**

Develop a lightweight monitoring utility (similar to *htop*) to display live system stats.

---

# 3. Memory Management 

Deep dive into how memory works in C++, from stack/heap operation to ownership patterns.

### **Lessons**

* **L1: Memory Fundamentals & System Memory Hierarchy** – Memory layout, caching, addresses, GDB.
* **L2: Pointers and Pointer Arithmetic** – Pointer safety, arithmetic, null/dangling pointers.
* **L3: Dynamic Memory Allocation & Ownership** – `new/delete`, avoiding leaks, ownership models.
* **L4: Copy Constructors, Move Semantics, Rule of Three/Five** – Deep copy vs shallow copy, RAII.
* **L5: Smart Pointers & Advanced Memory Management** – `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr` and patterns.

### **Project**

#### **Memory BOT**

Implement a terminal‑based chatbot that answers questions about C++ memory concepts.

---

# 4. Concurrency (6 hours)

Learn how to build multi‑threaded programs safely and efficiently.

### **Lessons**

* **L1: Threads and Parallel Execution** – Creating and managing threads, avoiding data races.
* **L2: Sharing Data & Synchronization** – Promises, futures, atomics, async operations.
* **L3: Mutexes, Locks, and Condition Variables** – Safe resource access, deadlock prevention.

### **Project**

#### **Concurrent Traffic Simulation**

Build a multi‑threaded traffic simulator using mutexes and synchronization techniques.

# 🎯 Summary of Tasks

Across the program you will:

* Build modular C++ applications
* Implement A* search from scratch
* Design full OOP class hierarchies
* Write robust, error‑safe code using RAII and modern C++ features
* Manage memory using smart pointers and move semantics
* Implement thread‑safe, concurrent systems

> **Note:** This project uses the official **Udacity Fixed-Wing Simulator** and includes **partial control code** intended for educational and practice purposes.
